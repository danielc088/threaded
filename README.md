wish list:
- front end in general (app style)
- rules based on temperature (i.e. cold = jacket, hot = tshirt)
- daily outfit reccomender + shuffle button for new reccomendation
- discover more (webscrape for item of clothings that might go well)
- general summary stats of item wear time, etc
- more clothing items in general
- concept of 'style' i.e. business, athleisure
- collaborative filtering. 
- feedback loop
- gap identifier, i.e. if an item of clothing had feature x you would get a boost in 40% of >= 4's
